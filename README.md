Geese have been labeled “silly” ever since the 15th century, often used as a metaphor for foolish or absurd behavior. The saying that resulted from this, “Silly goose,” has consequently been passed down from generation to generation until eventually reaching modern day. Today, we even have entire games dedicated to geese, such as Duck, Duck, Goose or Untitled Goose Game. And now, you can finally find these extraordinarily silly geese in Minecraft.

# Just a goose?
This isn't any kind of geese, it's the kind that will steal your weapon and use it against you.

Geese can be found near any lake or river, usually in small groups of 1–3. They’re harmless… most of the time.
Hang around them long enough and you might experience what’s known as a “Honk and Run.” They’ll waddle up, smack you, honk aggressively, and sprint away like nothing happened.

Just a word of warning: don’t take out your anger on them. If you kill a goose, the others will know, and they will retaliate. Their attacks aren’t deadly, but they absolutely try their hardest.

Oh, and did I mention they can steal your sword? Leave your weapon on the ground for too long and a curious goose might just grab it.

Instead of resorting to goose violence, maybe try offering them some seeds. It’s easier on everyone, and it turns out these silly geese are surprisingly willing to trade when they’re in a good mood.

There are three variants of geese. Temperate, Warm, and Cold. They, as the name states, spawn in biomes correlating to their type.
